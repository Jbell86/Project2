# Project2
 For project 2 I just followed the Bash Scripting tutorial. At first I was not really sure what I was supposed to 
 be doing, by the end it kind of started to make a little more sense.  I was pretty much building the script piece by
 piece.  I would learn something new and add it to the script.  By the end of the tutorial I had constructed a script
 to backup directories for different users.  One part in particular that I had an issue with was using the vi text editor.
 I did not catch the part in the pdf that said to use nano until I was halfway through the tutorial.
